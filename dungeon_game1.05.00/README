  PC and NPCs now move around the dungeon and attempt to kill each other. NPCs are represented by their traits a-f, 
as per the assignment pdf. Non-Telepathic monsters search the dungeon in order of rooms in the room array until the 
PC comes into line of sight. I have not yet implemented Dr. Sheaffer's 2d character array, instead I'm currently 
treating characters as terrain and storing the terrain they step onto in a .prev field. I am currently using
usleep(933333) for delay, which works very well on my machine but did seem a bit laggy on pyrite. Unfortunately, 
this was still the best I could get to work.
