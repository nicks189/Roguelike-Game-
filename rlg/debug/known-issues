######## ISSUES ########

- Performance -- run with profiling 
    1) Optimize pathfinding
- Issues with ranged combat:
    1) Casting spell/firing arrow doesn't consume turn
    2) Cancelling ranged combat consumes turn
- Effects rendering through walls
- NPC logic should be improved and move function refactored
