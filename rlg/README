Game now plays through ncurses and the PC can be controlled with the standard 
controls given in the PDF, with the single exception that exiting look mode 
requires double-tapping escape. Moreover on look mode: the screen shifts 20 
grid cells left/right or 10 grid cells up/down with respective commands.
