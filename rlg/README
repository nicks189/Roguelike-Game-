Game now uses both c and c++ files, complied seperately and linked. Character, npc, and pc files are now entirely
in c++. Character_util.cpp/h acts as mediator between c and c++ files; c files pass void pointers to character_util
functions which call c++ methods/constructors/etc and return void points/useful data. Fog of war is now also 
implemented; everything in view is in bold while remembered terrain is not. Monsters are only viewable within 5 
cells - not on remembered terrain.
